Secondly, what are considered to be the advantages of being a men in the workplace ? The disadvantages ? Finally,  is there any relationship between men who highly value being seen as masculine with recognizing possible advantanges of being a men ? Is there any relationship between the perception on masculinity with their opinions on possible disadvantages?  \n",
