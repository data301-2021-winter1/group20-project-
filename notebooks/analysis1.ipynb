    "My goal is to analyse a possible relationship between the importance of being seen as masculine with behavior in the workplace . Firstly , how important is it for men to be seen as masculine ?  Secondly, what are considered to be the advantages of being a men in the workplace ? The disadvantages ? Finally,  is there any relationship between men who highly value being seen as masculine with recognizing possible advantanges of being a men ? Is there any relationship between the perception on masculinity with their opinions on possible disadvantages?  \n",
