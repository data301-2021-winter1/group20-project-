## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Data Science as well as Computer Science are male dominated fields - with women representing only 18% of positions in the job market ( according to the Center for Global Development). As two female data science students , we thought it was extremely interesting and relevant to refelect and explore the reasons behind the disparity in such employment sector . To do so , analyzing the concept of masculinity through the lens of the modern men would lead us to a better understanding of the male identity. Further, its outcomes in many contexts , including in the workplace and daily behaviour. The survey also questions the limits of emotional vulnerability in terms of masculinity , from the stereotype of refusing to cry to avoiding self-concious acknowledgements . Taking all these factors into account, we want to know if such patterns contribute to the low percetange of women in the Data Science field - as if they create an uninviting enviroment and worsen the hive mentality of women being unqualified in the workplace. 
In addition , we are also very interested in men's reactions in face of the "#MeToo" movement. 
Finally , we belive we can construct a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset .
